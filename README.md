Our program supports two modes : terminal and Graphical User Interface.

When you execute the main function in the Main class, it will ask you wich mode you want to choose the mode.

If you are using the terminal mode,
after each line being executed, a prompt (starting with >>) is waiting for commands:
There are 5 commands:

- print <reg>
ex: print T0

- print <var>
ex: print A

- print memory
 
- print stack
 
- "next" or "n" to go to next instruction

- "end" to finish executing code

After the last line being executed (HLT) u can still input commands to
print the state of registers, memory and stack.

In order to execute your own files, they must be placed at the root of the project (see where .txt files are).
