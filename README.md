After each line being executed, a prompt (starting with >>) is waiting for commands:
- print <reg>
ex: print T0
- print <var>
ex: print A
- print memory
- "next" or "n" to go to next instruction
- "end" to finish executing code
After the last line being executed (HLT) u can still input commands to
print the state of registers, memory and stack.
